## What is a Snippet?

A snippet is a sharable piece(s) of code that allow for quick implementation to otherwise small things that are easy to forget about or get lost. Sometimes there are templates, and sometimes they can be as simple as a string that is encoded in a base64 format.

Use the categories in the menu to find and use my collection of snippets.
