# Getting Started

Congratulations! You have accepted a new job and are attempting to set your system up for maximum development goodness. There's only a few massive problems...

* You have no idea how to get started
* You have a shiny new compy with an M1Pro (or similar Apple Silicon/ARM chip)
* You have used Docker twice, and both times were more than 2 years ago
* The crew is short-staffed and no one really has time to stop and set you up

No worries, use the guides on the side to get the information you need to start winning. Please note that there is no one-size fits all, and as going with tech, what worked when this was written may not be working now.

Don't worry though, I can haz believe in you!
