# The Apps We Use

> _Rule #9; Always use the right tool for the job_
>
> &mdash; **Juan Cortez**

You have no doubt wondered which applications do what, and which ones you need. The following list should help you know which tools are useful for which job. Not all of the tools are required, but I am listing all of the ones that I am using (and maybe the rest of the team will add some new ones so I can say "we" with proper context)

## Apps

### Dev Utils

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) (terminal/console)
